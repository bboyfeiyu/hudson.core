Spring Bean Builder by using Groovy.

<p>
This code is <a href="http://grails.org/Spring+Bean+Builder">originally from Grails</a>
but modifications are made since then to make the syntax more consistent.

<h2>Changes to the original code</h2>
<p>
    Our version has support for getting rid of surrounding "bb.beans { ... }" if the script
    is parsed via the <tt>BeanBuilder.parse()</tt> method.
</p>
<p>
    Anonymous bean definition syntax is changed to <tt>bean(CLASS) {...}</tt> from
    <tt>{CLASS _ -> ...}</tt> to increase consistency with named bean definition.
</p>

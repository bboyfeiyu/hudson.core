    With this option checked, Hudson builds each configuration in a sequence.
    This can be useful if your configuration needs to access the shared resource
    like database, as well as to avoid crowding out other jobs.

    It's possible to use Project cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Project+cascading">

<div>
  If checked, Hudson will parse the POMs of this project, and see if any of its snapshot dependencies
  are built on this Hudson as well. If so, Hudson will set up build dependency relationship so that
  whenever the dependency job is built and a new SNAPSHOT jar is created, Hudson will schedule a build
  of this project.

  <p>
  This is convenient for automatically performing continuous integration. Hudson will check the snapshot
  dependencies from the &lt;dependency> element in the POM, as well as &lt;plugin>s and
  &lt;extension>s used in POMs.

  <p>
  If this behavior is problematic, uncheck this option.

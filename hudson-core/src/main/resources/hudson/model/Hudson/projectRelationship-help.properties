Title=What''s "project relationship"?
body=\
    When you have projects that depend on each other, Hudson can track which build of \
    the upstream project is used by which build of the downstream project, by using \
    the records created by \
    <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/fingerprint.html">the fingerprint support</a>.
